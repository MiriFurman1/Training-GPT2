      Title: Rock Candy
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  1
  ingredients:
      1    Glass jar or drinking glass
      1    Piece of cotton string
      1    Pencil or stick
      1    Paper clip
      1    Food coloring (optional)
      1 c  Water
      2 c  Sugar
           Additional sugar
   Directions:
  Tie a short piece of cotton string to the middle of the pencil or stick.
  Attach a paper clip to the end of the string for a weight.  Moisten the
  string very lightly, and roll in a bit of sugar (this will "attract" the
  sugar crystals from the syrup to the string).  Place the pencil or stick
  over the top of the glass or jar with the string hanging down inside.
  
  Heat the water to boiling, and dissolve the 2 cups of sugar into it.  For
  the biggest crystals FAST, heat the sugar-water solution a SECOND time, and
  dissolve as much additional sugar as you can into it.  Add a few drops of
  food coloring to the solution if desired.
  
  Pour the solution into the prepared glass or jar and leave undisturbed for
  a couple of days.  Depending on how much sugar you were able to dissolve
  into the water, you should start to see crystals growing in a few hours to
  a few days.

      Title: Stained Glass Candy
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
  ingredients:
  3 3/4 c  White sugar
  1 1/2 c  Lily white syrup (or Karo,
           -must be colorless)
      1 c  Water
           Food coloring
           Oil based flavorings such as
           - Wiltons
           Tin foil
           Icing sugar, approximately
           - 10 cups, can be reused
           - over and over
           Sharp pair of scisors
           Candy thermometer
           Lots of volunteers to help
   Directions:
  Mix the white sugar, white syrup, and water in a medium sized pot. Add the
  food coloring you want (green for spearmint, orange for orange) Bring to a
  boil, and boil until candy thermometer reaches 300 F degrees. (Can take up
  to 20 minutes)   Stir to mix all the ingredients, but once it starts to
  boil, do not touch.  Pot must be big enough to allow for double, as it
  rises as it boils
  
  While the candy mixture is boiling, shape a large piece of tin foil by
  folding up the sides and ends.  (I use the large foil about 3 feet long) to
  create a large cookie sheet type shape.  Put the icing sugar on the foil to
  completely cover it, and bank up the sides with icing sugar.
  
  When the candy mixture has reached 300F, remove from heat.  Let sit about
  10 seconds and stir to cool slightly (heavy emphasis on SLIGHTLY) Then add
  about 1 to 1-1/2 tsp of the oil based flavorings depending on how strong
  you want the flavor.  Stir until mixed (may boil a bit and DON'T stand over
  top of pot as flavor with escape in the air and up your nose!! 8-} ) Once
  flavoring is combined, pour mixture onto the icing sugar and use rubber
  spatula to scrape all mixture out of pot.  Put pot, spatula and candy
  thermometer into sinkful of hot soapy water.   As candy is cooling, keep
  checking by trying to pull up the edges.  Once it gets to the consistency
  that you can lift it a little, start cutting it FAST! I cut off a chunk and
  then cut it up into bite-sized pieces. The outside will cool first so you
  have to watch it.  If it hardens to quickly you will end up with a good
  size lollipop that you won't be able to cut. It will shatter like glass.
  Continue working your way around until all is cut. Then I take all the
  candy and put it in a strainer that is sitting over a bowl. Shake some of
  the excess icing sugar off candy and allow to cool thoroughly. Pack in
  airtight containers. I find Zip-Loc Freezer bags pretty good.

      Title: Truffes Au Chocolat (Chocolate Truffles)
 Categories: Chocolate, Candies, Christmas
   Servings:  1
  ingredients:
      3 oz Chocolate
  1 1/2 oz Butter
      2 oz Powdered sugar
      2 tb Fresh cream
 Directions:
  Preparation: Put cream, butter and grated chocolate into a pan. The
  chocolate need not be grated fine. The cream can be replaced by skimming
  the top off raw milk poured into a wide basin and allowed to settle. Melt
  butter, chocolate, and cream in a double boiler, stirring to mix well. When
  melted, remove the double boiler from the fire, leaving the hot water in
  the bottom pan to keep it warm. Sift the powdered sugar in slowly, so that
  it will not form lumps, stirring constantly. Let stand 24 hr. in a cool
  place. (In winter, 12 hr. in a cold room will do.) At the end of this time,
  cut a piece of this chocolate about the size of a small nut, using a knife
  or spoon. Roll it into a ball in the palm of the hand until the outside of
  the bonbon begins to melt a little. Then roll it in grated or granulated
  chocolate, which will stick to it perfectly. Let stand 2 hr. before
  serving, but in a place that is not too cold, because these truffles are
  better when they are a little soft. Instead of rolling them into balls, you
  can also shape them to look more like truffles.

  red food coloring and mix well.  Add the colored mixture to the remainder
  left in the pan and mix well.  Pour over the mixture already in the tin.

      Title: Vinegar Taffy
 Categories: Candies
   Servings:  6
  ingredients:
      1 c  Sugar
    1/2 c  Water
    1/4 c  Light corn syrup
    1/2 ts Salt
      2 tb Vinegar
      1 ts Vanilla or other flavoring
           -such as orange or lemon, or
           -use:
    1/2 ts Peppermint or:
      1 oz Bitter chocolate, grated
 
Directions:
  
  Cook sugar, water, corn syrup, salt and vinegar until a few drops of the
  mixture will make a hard ball in cold water, 260 degrees on a candy
  thermometer.  Pour onto a greased dish or platter, sprinkle flavoring over
  top and turn the outer edges of the candy in toward the center until cool
  and firm enough to handle.
  
  Best results are obtained in pulling if the tips of the thumbs and fingers
  are dipped in cornstarch or fat. Use only the fingertips to pull taffy.
  When mixture can be handled, take up and pull out with both hands. Fold
  over and pull out again.
  
  As the mixture becomes cooler and the longer it is pulled, it will become
  stiffer and can be pulled out in a longer strand.  Pull until it is
  difficult to pull out and the mixture seems quite firm.
  
  Pull into long thin strips and cut immediately with greased scissors and
  roll each piece in powdered sugar or wrap in wax paper. Store cooled taffy
  in an air tight container in a cool dry place.
  
  If the taffy sugars, it can be recooked by putting it in a pan with 2
  Tablespoons corn syrup and 1/4 cup water.  Stir until dissolved and then
  recook according to original directions.
  
  Finely chopped nuts or fruit, as well as other flavorings, are added as the
  taffy is being pulled.

      Title: Whiskey Balls
 Categories: Candies, Christmas
   Servings: 36
  ingredients:
      3 c  Vanilla wafer crumbs
    1/2 c  Finely chopped pecans
    1/2 c  Unsweetened cocoa
      2 c  Confectioner's sugar
    1/2 c  Bourbon
      3 tb Light corn syrup
           Salt, if desired
 Directions:
  1.  Blend together the crumbs, nuts, cocoa, 1 cup confectioner's sugar,
  bourbon, corn syrup, and a dash of salt.  Form into small balls the size of
  walnuts.
  
  2.  Roll each ball in the remaining 1 cup confectioner's sugar and place on
  a cookie sheet.  Chill in the refrigerator for several hours or overnight.
  
  Note:  It is traditional in the South to use bourbon, but rye may also be
  used. This confection -- or at least a version of it -- was an early
  Southern version of those chocolate truffles that became the rage for
  chocolate lovers during the 1980s in this country. The whiskey balls are
  made, of course, with cocoa rather than chocolate.
