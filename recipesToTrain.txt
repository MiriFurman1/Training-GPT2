4 large Poblano peppers
1 cup Queso fresco or Monterey Jack cheese, shredded
1 cup All-purpose flour
4 large Eggs, separated
Vegetable oil (for frying)
1 cup Tomato sauce or salsa (for serving)
Directions:
Preheat the broiler or grill to high heat. Place the poblano peppers on a baking sheet or grill pan. Broil or grill the peppers, turning occasionally, until their skins are blistered and charred all over, about 10-15 minutes. Remove the peppers from the heat and place them in a covered bowl to steam for about 10 minutes. This will make it easier to peel the skins.

After steaming, carefully peel the skins off the poblano peppers. Make a small slit along the side of each pepper and carefully remove the seeds and membranes, taking care not to tear the peppers.

Stuff each poblano pepper with shredded queso fresco or Monterey Jack cheese. Press the edges of the peppers together to seal the cheese inside.

In three separate shallow dishes, place the all-purpose flour in one, whisk the egg whites in another, and whisk the egg yolks in the third.

In a deep skillet or saucepan, heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat for frying. Roll each stuffed poblano pepper in flour, dip it into the egg whites, and then coat it in the egg yolks.

Fry the chiles rellenos in the hot oil until they are golden brown and the cheese inside is melted, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the chiles rellenos from the oil and drain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.

Serve the chiles rellenos hot with tomato sauce or salsa drizzled on top. These stuffed and fried peppers are a delightful Mexican dish that brings together the flavors of poblano peppers and melted cheese.

Directions:
In a large Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken leg quarters with salt and pepper. Add the chicken pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides until they become golden. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside. In the same pot, sauté the chopped bacon until it becomes crispy. Add the minced garlic, pearl onions, and halved button mushrooms to the pot. Sauté the vegetables until they become tender and slightly browned. Remove the vegetables from the pot and set them aside. In the same pot, melt the unsalted butter over medium heat. Stir in the all-purpose flour to form a roux. Cook the roux for a few minutes until it turns slightly golden. Slowly pour in the red wine and chicken broth, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.

Title: French Crème Brûlée
Categories: Desserts, French Cuisine
Servings: 4

Ingredients:

2 cups Heavy cream
1/2 cup Granulated sugar
1 Vanilla bean (or 1 teaspoon Vanilla extract)
4 large Egg yolks
4 tablespoons Granulated sugar (for caramelizing)
Directions:
Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). In a saucepan, heat the heavy cream over medium heat until it begins to simmer. Remove the saucepan from the heat. If using a vanilla bean, slice it lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with a knife. Add the vanilla bean seeds or vanilla extract to the cream. Let the mixture cool for a few minutes to allow the vanilla flavor to infuse. In a separate mixing bowl, whisk together the egg yolks and granulated sugar until the mixture becomes smooth and pale yellow. Slowly pour the warm cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly to avoid curdling. Strain the custard mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps or vanilla bean remnants . Divide the custard mixture evenly among four ramekins or oven-safe dishes.

Place the ramekins in a large baking dish. Carefully pour enough hot water into the baking dish to reach halfway up the sides of the ramekins, creating a water bath.

Bake the crème brûlée in the preheated oven for about 35-40 minutes, or until the custard is set but still slightly jiggly in the center. The edges should be firm, but the center should have a slight wobble.

Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. Once cooled, cover the ramekins with plastic wrap and refrigerate them for at least 2 hours or preferably overnight to allow the flavors to develop and the custard to fully set.

Before serving, sprinkle about 1 tablespoon of granulated sugar evenly over the top of each crème brûlée. Using a kitchen torch, carefully caramelize the sugar until it turns golden and forms a crispy caramelized layer on top of the custard.

Allow the crème brûlée to cool for a minute or two to let the caramelized sugar harden. Serve the French crème brûlée as a decadent and creamy dessert, offering a delightful contrast of creamy custard and crunchy caramelized sugar.

Place the assembled sandwiches on the preheated panini press, grill pan, or skillet. Cook the croque monsieur sandwiches for a few minutes on each side, pressing them gently with a spatula to create those distinct grill marks.

Title: Ethiopian Injera
Categories: Breads, Ethiopian Cuisine
Servings: 6

Ingredients:

2 cups Teff flour (or a mixture of teff and other flours)
1 1/2 cups Water
1/2 teaspoon Active dry yeast (optional)
Salt to taste
Directions:
In a large bowl, whisk together the teff flour, water, and active dry yeast (if using), creating a smooth and slightly runny batter. Cover the bowl with a clean kitchen towel and let the batter ferment at room temperature for about 12-24 hours. The fermentation process allows the injera to develop its distinct sour taste and bubbly texture. After the fermentation period, the batter should have a slightly tangy aroma and a bubbly appearance on the surface.

In a non-stick or lightly oiled skillet or crepe pan, heat it over medium heat. Pour a ladleful of the fermented injera batter onto the hot surface, spreading it out in a circular motion to create a thin, crepe-like layer. Cook the injera for about 1-2 minutes, or until the edges lift and the surface becomes dotted with tiny holes. Injera is traditionally cooked only on one side, without flipping, as it should remain soft and pliable. Once cooked, remove the injera from the skillet and place it on a plate or platter, covering it with a clean kitchen towel to keep it warm and moist. Repeat the process with the remaining batter, making more injera rounds.

Serve the Ethiopian Injera warm, accompanying it with a variety of Ethiopian stews and dishes. In Ethiopian cuisine, injera serves as both a staple and an eating utensil. Tear off pieces of injera and use them to scoop up the flavorful stews, meats, and vegetables. The sour and spongy injera adds a unique dimension to Ethiopian meals and is an essential part of the dining experience.
